    <h2> In my 5x5 assignment, I decided to focus down on Google searches. I chose to specifically look at the Google, “I’m Feeling Lucky” function, due to the fact I haven’t used it before. I decided to use this function three times a day for the next five days and document where the “I’m Feeling Lucky” button took me. I took three screenshots each day of the specific website it brought me to. Along with this, I took the three keywords that the search gave me and wrote a three line poem for each day. Poetry is something I am not used to doing. Thus, I wanted this assignment to force me to explore a medium that I am not comfortable with exploring, along with giving me specific constraints to help direct me and give my poems a proper frame of reference. <h2>
