	<h2> GROWING UP ASIAN </h2>
	<p>
		"It was really hard for me to embrace my queer identity because I was
		<br> already getting made fun of for being Asian." - Dahee

		<br>
		
		This artcile speaks about statistics and difficulties regarding coming out for Asians and Pacific Islanders.
		<br>
			â€œWhile many LGBTQ people are familiar with the intolerance of 
			<br>society at large, Asian Pacific Americans must also deal with cultural differences.
			<br> Coming out experiences are often intensified by a lack of visibility, racism and language"

		<br>LGBT Latino and Asian community. Accumulating evidence indicates that some lesbians, gay men,
		<br>and bisexual individuals, as compared to heterosexual women and men, may be at elevated risk 
		<br>for psychological and substance use morbidity, especially lifetime histories of suicide attempts.
		<br>This source specifies what types of issues lead to these mental health problems such as the external
		<br> racism that asians and latinos face as opposed to the white LGBT community.

<br>

 	In countries around asia, such as Indonesia, being queer is still a huge taboo and is seen as incriminating traits. 
	<br>There has been legistation imposed to set the death penalty as punishment for being LGBT and legistation to 
	<br> imprison and fine those that are openly queer. Repressive and Opressive acts have continued to occur and rise 
	<br> in these countries such as death threats, social exclusion, excommunication, and public humiliation.

		<br>
		
		This video was Eugene's personal perspective on growing up in America as an Asian 
		<br>and the different types of bullying he faced. He talked about being and artist 
		<br> and his interest in film that led him to discover that there was a huge lack 
		<br> of asian representation in media. He also talked about how "no one ever asked"
		<br> whether asians were capable in the first place.
